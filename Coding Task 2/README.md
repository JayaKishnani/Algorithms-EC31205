# CODING TASK 2 - GRAPH ALGORITHMS

## General Guide
1. Open the colab notebook 20EC30020_Q1.ipynb for problem-1 and 20EC30020_Q2.ipynb for problem-2.
2. Run the cell by either clicking run button or by pressing <code>'Shift' + 'Enter' </code>

## Problem-1 Dijkstra's algorithm for directed graph

1. <b>Section 1 :</b> contains definition of the graph and the function to print the paths.
2. <b>Section 2 :</b> contains the implementation of dijkstra's algorithm.

## Problem-2 Bellman ford's algorithm for shortest path

1. <b>Section 1 :</b> contains definition of the graph and the function to print the paths.
2. <b>Section 2 :</b> contains the implementation of bellman ford algorithm and it's comparison with dijkstra's algorithm. In this section it was observed that dijkstra algorithm works equivalently as bellman-ford's algorithm.
3. <b>Section 3 :</b> contains the implementation of bellman ford algorithm and it's comparison with dijkstra's algorithm. In this section it was observed that dijkstra algorithm fails.
4. <b>Section 4 :</b> contains the implementation of bellman ford algorithm where it fails in case of introduction of negative weight cycle.
